// Algorithms can be divided with functions by for example separating tasks by what they're dealing with
// For example if one part of an algorithm is related specifically to something it can be worth it to
// make that part into it's own function. One of the key elements of functions is of course repetition, so making
// a function for an algorithm or a part of an algorithm that won't be repeated is a bit of a waste.
// If an algorithm uses very specific nuggets of information at given points these could be identified as potential
// parameters for functions that the algorithm is divided into.
